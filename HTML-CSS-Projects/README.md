This is a collection of my HTML/CSS-based projects initiated on freeCodeCamp and other learning platforms.<br>
Although these projects are certification projects required by different learning platforms, I intend to expand and customize them, as my skill sets expand.<br>
Therefore, these projects may grow to the extent that completely exceeds the basic requirements of the initial projects.<br>
Consequently, this repository will be in constant development and therefore subject to updates.<br>
To keep it alive and thriving, I welcome any comments and constructive critiques.<br>
