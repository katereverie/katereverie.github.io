            <p id='tribute-info'>She was timid, so much so that<br/>she backed herself into the corner of the dining room and shat herself,<br/> when Christopher's friends visited with their big dog.</p>
            <p id='tribute-info'>Nevertheless, she was sweet.<br/> She would always pur around Christopher.<br/>She would be extra sweet, of course, when she wants food.</p>
